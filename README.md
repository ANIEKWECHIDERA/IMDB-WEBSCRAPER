# IMDBWEBSCRAPER
This is a web scraper program written in Python for extracting the top 250 movies from IMDB and loading the data onto an excel Workbook.
I created this because i wanted to be able to create my own data sets for practicing my data analyst skills. it was a really fun and educative project,
it has also hepled me to brush up on my python skills.
